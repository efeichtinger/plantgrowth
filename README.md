# plantgrowth - nonlinear models for plant growth 
plantgrowth contains functions for describing plant growth to account for different functional forms of growth for plant species
as outlined in Paine et al. 2012

Individuals across plant species differ in growth trajectories (functional forms) 
plantgrowth is useful for ecological simulations including individual-based simulations for theoretical ecology 

## Features
functions for estimating absolute growth rate (AGR), relative growth rate (RGR) as a function of time and biomass, and biomass at time t

1. Power law 
2. Monomolecular 
3. Three-parameter logistic
